# pong

I just wanted to teach myself a little bit of Godot and see what it was like. I've never made a game before, so I thought I'd start with something simple.

Currently it just has the player, ball, and enemy. The ball will bounce opposite Y axis depending on what side of the paddle it hits and like 2 lines of enemy "AI" (aka moving up or down depending on the ball's location) and a refresh key.
